# PlexPals
Some little pals I've been tinkering with for Plex

# Setup
* Download the PlexPals project
* Update *PlexPals_GlobalConfig.ini* with the locations of the applications used by the scripts
* Within ecah script subfolder, update the *config.ini* to point to whichever folders and use the properties you wish
* Enable PowerShell scripts on your system.
* Right-click the chosen script and choose "Run with Powershell"
