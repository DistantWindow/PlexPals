#            HEVC STUTTER FIX - REMUXER           #
#=================================================#

Sometimes, an .MP4 file in x265 HEVC format will not play correctly on Plex apps (such as Android,
Chromecast, or Smart TV players). The fix is to remux the MP4 into an MKV file, which does... something
and prevents the stuttering, framey playback.

Required Software: 
MKVMerge (https://mkvtoolnix.download/downloads.html)

Usage:
1 - Install MKVMerge

2 - Edit the Powershell script and update the $mkvMergePath to point to mkvmerge.exe

3 - When you encounter a file that is having this issue, copy and paste the remux script into the location where the file is.
  --Currently it is designed for movies, expecting one mp4 file and one or two subtitles. If this issue is happening with a TV series, for now,
    create a temporary subfolder to drop a single episode into at a time. I plan to fix this soon.

4 - With the script, the affected video, and its subtitles all in one place, right-click the script and Run With Powershell

5 - The script will look for an .mp4, and then identify all .srt files with the same name, and bundle all of these into an MKV file with MKVMerge.
    This takes about a minute to run usually.

6 - Delete the mp4 file and rescan your Plex library to pick up the new MKV. The stuttering should now be gone.
