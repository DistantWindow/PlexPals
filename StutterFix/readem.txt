#            HEVC STUTTER FIX - REMUXER           #
#=================================================#

Sometimes, an .MP4 file in x265 HEVC format will not play correctly on Plex apps (such as Android,
Chromecast, or Smart TV players); I've also run into issues with files not playing on some players because of a problem with a subtitle transcoder. 
The fix is to remux the MP4 into an MKV file, which does... something
and prevents the stuttering, framey playback.
Or maybe you just want those slovenly mp4/srt pairs cleaned up into something charmingly, Swedishly sleek and minimalist. At any rate, these are for that.

Required Software: 
MKVMerge (https://mkvtoolnix.download/downloads.html)

Usage:

:::For Remux In Place - 

1 - Install MKVMerge

2 - Edit the Powershell script and update the $mkvMergePath to point to mkvmerge.exe

3 - When you encounter a file that is having this issue, copy and paste the remux-inPlace script into the location where the file is.
  --The script will affect all files in the current folder. If it's a season of TV for instance, with 10 videos and 10 subtitles,
    each will be paired up and remuxed into a separate .mkv

4 - With the script, the affected video, and its subtitles all in one place, right-click the script and Run With Powershell

5 - The script will look for an .mp4, and then identify all .srt files with the same name, and bundle all of these into an MKV file with MKVMerge.
    This usually takes a little less than a minute per video

6 - Delete the mp4 file and rescan your Plex library to pick up the new MKV. The stuttering should now be gone.

:::For Batch Remux - 

1 - Install MKVMerge

2 - Edit the Powershell script and update the $mkvMergePath to point to mkvmerge.exe
  - Edit the $batchPath to point to a txt file containing lists of directories (ie remuxList.txt)

3 - Add all directories containing files to remux to your remuxList.txt file.

4 - Right-click the remuxBatch.ps1 script and Run with Powershell.

5 - The script will check each folder provided for mp4 files and any matching SRTs, and bundle all of these into an MKV file with MKVMerge.
    This usually takes a little less than a minute per video 

6 - Delete the mp4 file and rescan your Plex library to pick up the new MKV. The stuttering should now be gone.
