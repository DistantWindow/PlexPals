#            BATCH YT-DLP DOWNLOADER              #
#=================================================#

Required Software: 
YT-DLP (https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)

Usage:
1 - Install YT-DLP
2 - Edit the Powershell script and update the Configuration section as desired.
  --Provide the location to download to at $DownloadBase
  --Enter the location to read the lists of URLs from at $InputBase
  --Provide the location of YT-DLP at $ytDlpPath
  --If you want YT-DLP to attempt to add a Season identifier to the prefix of each file, set $PrefixSeasonNo to $true
  --Set the options for $formatArgs, $cookieArgs, $subtitleArgs, and $naming format as desired.
    Refer to the YT-DLP documentation for more information on how to set these.

3 - Save a list of URLs to download via YT-DLP in a new text file. If the file represents a season of something, end the filename
    with the season in "SXX" format (ie "GoodEatsS12")

4 - Save the text file in the location provided above for $InputBase

5 - Repeat steps 3-5 as needed.

6 - Right-click DownloadBatches.ps1 and click Run with Powershell

7 - Each text file in your Input folder will be processed via YT-DLP.
    The contents of each file will download to a seperate subfolder in the specified download location, with the same name as the
    text file.

8 - If $PrefixSeasonNo is true, the season indicator (eg S04) from the text file will be used as a prefix for each file in that batch.
    YT-DLP doesn't have a reliable way to number episodes so by default an episode tag of "EXX" will be added after the season prefix,
    followed by the chosen naming format. If $prefixSeasonNo is $false, only the naming format will be used.
